# (Bonus) Implement a Menu Command:
Create a menu command that displays available commands from the command dictionary at the application's start and when the user types "menu." 

# Testing and Code Coverage:
With the calculator commands integrated, update and expand your tests to achieve 100% test coverage, ensuring your program's functionality is fully verified.

# Plugin Architecture:
Learn to refactor your program to automatically load plugins, facilitating easy command additions without manual updates.
